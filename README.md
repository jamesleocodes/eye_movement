# Eye movement(smooth pursuit) classifiers

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning approach for classifying eye movements between healthy control (HC) and Parkinson's disease (PK) individuals based on different degrees of eye movements.

# Overview

Eye movement analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and understanding various neurological disorders. Smooth pursuit eye movements are particularly relevant for differentiating between healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's disease. This project aims to use machine learning techniques to build classifiers that can accurately classify eye movements as either HC or PK based on different degrees of eye movements.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of eye movement data from a group of healthy control individuals and individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The data includes various features extracted from eye movement recordings, such as velocity, acceleration, position, and specific degrees of eye movements (1°, 2°, 4°, 6°, and 8°).

# Requirements
Python 3.x   
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided example notebooks)
